    <p>The equation for calculating the area of a square is: <b>A = s<sup>2</sup></b>where A is the area and s is the side length.</p>
    <p>The Pythagorean theorem is:<b> a<sup>2</sup>+ b<sup>2</sup> = c <sup>2</sup>,</b> where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse.</p>
    <p>The formula for compound interest is:<b> A = P(1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup></b>, where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.</p>
